# Project Rubric

## Agent Deployment & Tool Integration

### Deploy an AI agent to a cloud runtime
- Code includes a `BedrockAgentCoreApp` instance created at module level.
- An async `invoke` function uses the `@app.entrypoint` decorator.
- Code uses `app.run()` as the main entry point.
- Submitted test output shows the agent responding to an `agentcore invoke` command without errors.

### Integrate external tools using the Model Context Protocol
- Code connects to a Gateway endpoint using `MCPClient`.
- Code loads Gateway tools and adds them to the agent's tools list.
- Submitted test conversation log includes successful invocations of at least two distinct
  Gateway-backed tools (one API-based target, one Lambda-based target).
- Each tool invocation in the test log returns a well-formed response (not an error or empty result).

## Agent Intelligence

### Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation with a knowledge base
- Code includes a `search_knowledge_base` function using the `@tool` decorator.
- The tool function calls the Retrieve API.
- The tool function joins retrieved text chunks and returns them as a single formatted string.
- Code includes a guard clause that returns a descriptive message when `KB_ID` is not configured.
- The `@tool`-decorated function includes a docstring that describes when the agent should call it.

### Implement cross-session agent memory with retrieval and persistence
- Code includes a `get_namespaces` function that fetches strategy types and namespace templates
  from the memory resource, using `namespaceTemplates` or the legacy `namespaces` field.
- A `MemoryHook` class extends `HookProvider` and registers hooks via a `register_hooks` method.
- Code includes a `retrieve_customer_context` function that queries all strategy namespaces,
  tags memories by strategy type, and prepends them to the user message.
- Code includes a `save_support_interaction` function that extracts the last user query and
  assistant response and calls `memory_client.create_event()`.
- Submitted test conversation log demonstrates cross-session recall: two separate sessions using
  the same customer ID, where the second session retrieves information stored in the first.

### Execute computational tasks via a sandboxed code interpreter
- Code includes a `calculate_loyalty_discount` function using the `@tool` decorator.
- The tool function builds a self-contained Python code string that encodes business rules for
  points redemption, tier discounts, and earn rates.
- Code executes the code string via `code_session(REGION).invoke("executeCode", ...)` with
  `clearContext=True`.
- Code includes a fallback path that computes a tier-only discount when the code interpreter
  is unavailable.
- The tool returns a structured result containing all of the following fields:
  `points_redeemed`, `tier_discount_pct`, `final_total`, `remaining_points`.

### Enable web browsing capabilities through a browser tool
- Code instantiates `AgentCoreBrowser` with the AWS region.
- Code adds the agentcore browser to the agent's tools list.
- Submitted test output shows the agent retrieving content from a live web page.

## Code Quality & Reflection

### Reflect on design decisions and production considerations
- Submission includes a written reflection of 200-400 words.
- Reflection names a specific tool or integration from the project and explains why an
  implementation choice was made.
- Reflection describes a concrete challenge encountered during the project and the steps taken
  to resolve it.
- Reflection discusses at least one production consideration (e.g., scalability, cost, security,
  monitoring) with a specific example of how it applies to this agent.

## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out
- **Structured output validation** - Define Pydantic models for tool responses (e.g., order
  status, discount breakdown) and validate agent outputs against them.
- **Conversation summarization** - When session history exceeds a token budget, summarize older
  turns instead of dropping them.
- **Personalize the agent scenario** - Adapt the agent to another domain, replacing the product
  catalog and tool functions while keeping the same architectural patterns.
